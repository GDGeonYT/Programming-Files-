    <h4 id="Kinemaster">Kinemaster</h4>
    <p>This is where my editing journey started, way back in Grade 6. Editing was new to me so I tried messing around with stuff
      and suddenly I've gotten the hang of it. Younger me was amazed of my editing skills and also end of Grade 6 was where I started
      a Youtube Channel.

    <h4 id="Filmora">Filmora</h4>
    <p>This is where I had my first laptop, Grade 7. This was a big jump from mobile editing to pc. There's alot of tools which made it
      a little bit complicated but as time goes by It was now easy. The fact it was easy is actually its a little bit easy to use the
      workspace.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Premiere Pro & After Effects">Premiere Pro & After Effects</h4>
    <p>This is where things take to a whole new level, Adobe Apps. If we base this from Filmora's Workspace, premiere pro is much more
      complicated to learn so I decided to watch a 101 course to help me understand stuff. So then I tried, and tried, and tried until
      It was easy for me. It was my first time also discovering that you can add presets to make the work easier. Now for the After Effects
      Part... its actually similar to Premiere Pro but after effects is MOSTLY on animations and graphics. The workspace is kinda similar
      compare to premiere pro its just that after effects is a bit more tricky since it involves alot of new tools including speed, value
      etc. graphs.
